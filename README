This is a simple utility to drag and resize windows with modifier keys.
It is functionally similar to most Linux window managers and AltDrag on Windows.

To use, hold down the Option(Alt) key and drag the window to move it.
right-clicking and dragging will resize the window instead.

In either case, pressing Control will focus the window.
